My name is Serena, I'm originally from Italy but I'm living here in Ireland since 2016. I have 10 years of experience working in creches and with children both in Italy and Ireland. I decided to open my own childminding service in my house because as a mom I know how hard it is to leave children in the creches where teachers are changing all the time and it's hard for both children and families to establish a trust relationship with carers. I did a lot of preparation in my house to make it children-proof and to allow spaces where children could play, work on crafts and express and improve their natural skills.

Here are my qualifications:
- Garda Vetted
- 10 Years of experience with children, with references
- Bachelor's Degree in Psychology
- Master's Degree in Psychology
- Master's Degree in Pedagogy (ongoing)
